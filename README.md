# References
Throughout this project, we extensively utilised the labs to help us get our site running. Specifically:

Lab 10: Used as a base template to kickstart the project structure and logic.
Lab 6: Adapted for the custom user model and custom user authentication.
Lab 5: Referenced for CRUD functionality.
Additionally, for product sales features, we used the following external resource:

[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7pnR408jVU&list=PLCC34OHNcOtpRfBYk-8y0GMO4i1p1zn50&index=5]
: The sale_price and _on_sale model logic and the sales badge implementation were adapted from this resource.

For CSS, we borrowed ideas from our client-side labs, particularly:

Styling for product cards, hover effects, and consistent sizing.
Implementing a .product-card:hover effect to visually indicate when an item is hovered.

##External Libraries Used
--Django: Python web framework.
--Bootstrap: Front-end framework for styling.
--Pillow: For image handling.
--Stripe:Handeling the payements
